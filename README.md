### [How to Read a Paper | S. Keshav](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) ###

*Abstract* : Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much
wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient
three-pass method for reading research papers. I also describe how to use this method to do a literature survey.

## Social Cognition | Review | 2008 ##
### [Review | Social Cognition | Chris D. Frith](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2375957/pdf/rstb20080005.pdf) ###
*Abstract* : Social cognition concerns the various psychological processes that enable individuals to take advantage
of being part of a social group. Of major importance to social cognition are the various social signals
that enable us to learn about the world. Such signals include facial expressions, such as fear and
disgust, which warn us of danger, and eye gaze direction, which indicate where interesting things can
be found. Such signals are particularly important in infant development. Social referencing, for
example, refers to the phenomenon in which infants refer to their mothers’ facial expressions to
determine whether or not to approach a novel object. We can learn a great deal simply by observing
others. Much of this signalling seems to happen automatically and unconsciously on the part of both
the sender and the receiver. We can learn to fear a stimulus by observing the response of another, in the
absence of awareness of that stimulus. By contrast, learning by instruction, rather than observation,
does seem to depend upon awareness of the stimulus, since such learning does not generalize to
situations where the stimulus is presented subliminally. Learning by instruction depends upon a metacognitive process through which both the sender and the receiver recognize that signals are intended to
be signals. An example would be the ‘ostensive’ signals that indicate that what follows are intentional
communications. Infants learn more from signals that they recognize to be instructive. I speculate that
it is this ability to recognize and learn from instructions rather than mere observation which permitted
that advanced ability to benefit from cultural learning that seems to be unique to the human race.



## Machine Learning | Convolutional Neural Network | Application ## 
### [Judging a Book by Its Cover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09204.pdf) ### 

*Abstract* : Book covers communicate information to potential
readers, but can that same information be learned by computers?
We propose using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
predict the genre of a book based on the visual clues provided by
its cover. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether
relationships between books and their covers can be learned.
However, determining the genre of a book is a difficult task
because covers can be ambiguous and genres can be overarching.
Despite this, we show that a CNN can extract features and
learn underlying design rules set by the designer to define a
genre. Using machine learning, we can bring the large amount of
resources available to the book cover design process. In addition,
we present a new challenging dataset that can be used for many
pattern recognition tasks.
