### [How to Read a Paper | S. Keshav](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) ###

*Abstract* : Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much
wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient
three-pass method for reading research papers. I also describe how to use this method to do a literature survey.

### [Judging a Book by Its Cover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09204.pdf) ### 

*Abstract* : Book covers communicate information to potential
readers, but can that same information be learned by computers?
We propose using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
predict the genre of a book based on the visual clues provided by
its cover. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether
relationships between books and their covers can be learned.
However, determining the genre of a book is a difficult task
because covers can be ambiguous and genres can be overarching.
Despite this, we show that a CNN can extract features and
learn underlying design rules set by the designer to define a
genre. Using machine learning, we can bring the large amount of
resources available to the book cover design process. In addition,
we present a new challenging dataset that can be used for many
pattern recognition tasks.
